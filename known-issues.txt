Known Issues:

There are too many bugs, but there are some that I already know about and working on that you can brace yourself for.

- There are possible item duplication problems. A couple of times, I have seen more contracts and coins in my inventory than what I actually have on Archipelago. Workaround: Edit the save file. Coins is called "money" in the main game save file, and "contracts" is in the ap save file. (Might be fixed)

- There are visual glitches with the shop. I remember one time (ONLY ONCE) after buying an item, an unavailable item (labeled already bought) would appear. This is harmless, and if it is clogging the shop, then just leave and re-enter.

- There is a current bug with stoning and using a super. Cannot confirm reproducible yet.

- Traps: Most of the traps are broken as they caused major game breaking soft locks. They are disabled in this version for your own safety until this issue is resolved.
