Known Issues:

There are bugs that are known. There are less than before, but new alpha releases can cause breakages. Tread carefully!

- Sometimes the items do not restock, or a "sold" item clogs the shop. Leave and re-enter to fix.

- Traps are still disabled. This is because they have not been resolved at this time.

- Chalice is disabled for now. There are technical issues to get around.

- Some cutscenes cannot be configured to autoskip (incomplete). Just press start to skip them.

- Once in awhile, the client will crash.

- Make sure a specific configuration works before starting a multiworld! There are certain combinations that I have not tested.

- The die house chalkboard is inaccurate (in some places) when required contracts is lower than default.

- There is a possibility (cannot confirm) that you can drop platforms without duck.

- Chalice ingredient notification when all Isle 4 bosses are finished (this does mean you have the required ingredients!)
