Known Issues:

There are too many bugs. While I have fixed a lot of them, there are still issues that need to be worked out. There are some that I already aware of that you can brace yourself for.

- There are visual glitches with the shop. I remember one time (ONLY ONCE) after buying an item, an unavailable item (labeled already bought) would appear. This is harmless, and if it is clogging the shop, then just leave and re-enter.

- Traps are still disabled. This is because they have not been resolved at this time.

- Chalice is disabled for now. There are technical issues to get around.

- Some settings in the config do not work (For example, some cutscenes will not be skipped despite the config). Do not take it to heart.

- There are certain instabilities when it comes to the client connecting and reconnecting. Crashes may occur.

- I did not test all of the modes (goals). In only tested the devil and saltbaker goal. Make sure it works before doing an important multiworld.
