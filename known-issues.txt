Known Issues:

There are bugs that are known. There are less than before, but new alpha releases can cause breakages. Tread carefully!

- Sometimes the items do not restock, or a "sold" item clogs the shop. Leave and re-enter to fix.

- Traps are still disabled. This is because they have not been resolved at this time.

- Some cutscenes cannot be configured to autoskip (incomplete). Just press start to skip them.

- Once in awhile, the client will crash.

- Some sounds will not play depending on the level/world. (Notable: item recieve sound, ingredient sound)

- There have been instances where items are not recieved correctly. Current workaround is to clear receivedItems from APData. The mod is designed to properly recover the items without adding duplicates.

- Make sure a specific configuration works before starting a multiworld! There are certain combinations that I have not tested.
