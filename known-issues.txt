Known Issues:

There are bugs that are known. There are less than before, but new alpha releases can cause breakages. Tread carefully!

- Sometimes the items do not restock, or a "sold" item clogs the shop. Leave and re-enter to fix.

- Traps are still disabled. This is because they have not been resolved at this time.

- Some cutscenes cannot be configured to autoskip (incomplete). Just press start to skip them.

- Once in awhile, the client will crash.

- Some sounds will not play depending on the level/world. (Notable: item recieve sound, ingredient sound)

- There have been instances where items are not recieved correctly. Current workaround is to clear receivedItems from APData. The mod is designed to properly recover the items without adding duplicates.

- Some parts of the game will behave incorrectly if the FPS is anything other than 60. VSync will make the game ingore the framerate limit which is bad on faster monitors. Turn off vsync if you have this issue!

- Make sure a specific configuration works before starting a multiworld! There are certain combinations that I have not tested.
